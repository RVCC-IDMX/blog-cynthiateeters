Recently, I got inspired by a Twitter tag #learninpublic. So I tracked it down to this blog by Shawn Wang at [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I recommend that you read the whole article but let's start with this statement.



>> You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people “learn in private”, and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that’s fine, but we’re here to talk about being in the top quintile.

His observation is so true. Most of us learn in private, completely throwing away the opportunity that sharing that process offers to ourselves and to others.

**Now that I have a blog, let's start to Learn in Public!**
